The user wants to see the evaluation metrics, which typically include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and possibly a confusion matrix. To achieve this, I will need to modify the evaluation code to compute these metrics after evaluating the model on the test dataset.

I will update the plan to include the calculation of these metrics using the sklearn library, which provides convenient functions for this purpose. The updated plan will involve:

Importing necessary functions from sklearn.
Calculating predictions on the test dataset.
Computing and displaying the confusion matrix and classification report.
I will now formulate the updated plan and prepare to implement these changes in the face.ipynb file.



Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task:

Updated Plan:
Load the Test Dataset: As previously planned.
Evaluate the Model: Use the model.evaluate() method to calculate the accuracy.
Calculate the Confusion Matrix: Use the predictions from the model to compute the confusion matrix.
Display the Results: Print the accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.
Proposed Code Snippet to Add:
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay

# Assuming you have a test dataset similar to the training dataset
test_directory = "test/"  # Path to the test dataset
test_classes = ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"]  # Same classes as training

# Load test data
test_data = []
for category in test_classes:
    path = os.path.join(test_directory, category)
    class_num = test_classes.index(category)
    for img in os.listdir(path):
        try:
            img_array = cv2.imread(os.path.join(path, img))
            new_array = cv2.resize(img_array, (img_size, img_size))
            test_data.append([new_array, class_num])
        except Exception as e:
            pass

# Prepare test data
x_test = []
y_test = []
for feature, label in test_data:
    x_test.append(feature)
    y_test.append(label)

x_test = np.array(x_test).reshape(-1, img_size, img_size, 3) / 255.0
y_test = np.array(y_test)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = new_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
print(f"Test Loss: {loss:.4f}")

# Predictions for confusion matrix
y_pred = np.argmax(new_model.predict(x_test), axis=1)

# Calculate and display confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm, display_labels=test_classes)
disp.plot(cmap=plt.cm.Blues)
plt.show()
